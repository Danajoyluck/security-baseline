# Introduction
## Context and Scope
This document is the second part of the OpenSSF technology consumption architecture series. It captures the open source technologies that are hosted in OpenSSF, provided by Google, CNCF and source control management systems(SCM). Building on top of the technologies introduced in [open source software dependency management](./consumption-architecture-dependency-management.md), this document expands on  OSS security technologies and ecosystem supports that make software supply chain more secure through vulnerability management. 

The goals of this document are:
1. To help open source software producers discover, adopt as appropriate, and contribute to technical initiatives of OpenSSF (and related foundations) to improve vulnerability management. 
2. To provide an easy model for our end user organizations large and small to have a framework/reference architecture to help them manage vulnerabilities using open source technologies. 

Vulnerabilities in an open source software and its dependencies are in the scope of this document. This document serves as a map that takes readers from here to OpenSSF and adjacent technologies. Details of the open source technologies are out of the scope of this document. How consumers manage vulnerabilities is out of the scope of this document.   

This document is inspired and based on the previous work conducted in OpenSSF [Vulnerability Disclosure Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/blob/main/README.md), and Google's vulnerability management framework [Know, Prevent, Fix](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/02/know-prevent-fix-framework-for-shifting.html). 

## Intended Audience
Open source software maintainers, contributors and consumers are the intended audience of this document.

The document answers these questions:
* As an open source software producer, I'd like to produce more secure open source software. What OpenSSF resources can I leverage to manage vulnerabilities in my own code and dependencies? 
* As an open source software consumer, I'd like to consume secure open source software. What resources does OpenSSF provide for vulnerability management? 
* As an open source software producer and a consumer, I'd like to contribute to open source security technologies for vulnerability management. Where do I start? 

## Nomenclature
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

# Open Source Software Vulnerability Management 

As we discussed in [open source software dependency management](./consumption-architecture-dependency-management.md#open-source-software-dependency-management), open source software is the foundation of the digital world we live in. Managing software dependency is one aspect of vulnerability management. It is critical to manage all aspects of open source software vulnerability in order to sustain open source software security and reliability. OpenSSF has established a [security baseline](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/security_baseline.md) to help minimize vulnerabilities as a software project goes through the development lifecycle. 

The next few sections will dive deeper into these topics: 
* [Vulnerability Prevention](#vulnerability-prevention)
* [Asset Inventory](#asset-inventory)
* [Vulnerability Discovery in Your Own Code and Fix](#vulnerability-discovery-in-your-own-code-and-fix)
* [Publicly Known Vulnerability Exploitability and Patching](#publicly-known-vulnerability-exploitability-and-patching)
* [Coordinate Vulnerability Disclosure](#coordinate-vulnerability-disclosure)
