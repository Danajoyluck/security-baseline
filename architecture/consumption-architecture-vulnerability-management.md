# Introduction
## Context and Scope
This document is the second part of the OpenSSF technology consumption architecture series. It captures the open source technologies that are hosted in OpenSSF, provided by Google, CNCF and source control management systems(SCM). Building on top of the technologies introduced in [open source software dependency management](./consumption-architecture-dependency-management.md), this document expands on  OSS security technologies and ecosystem supports that make software supply chain more secure through vulnerability management. 

The goals of this document are:
1. To help open source software producers discover, adopt as appropriate, and contribute to technical initiatives of OpenSSF (and related foundations) to improve vulnerability management. 
2. To provide an easy model for our end user organizations large and small to have a framework/reference architecture to help them manage vulnerabilities using open source technologies. 

Vulnerabilities in an open source software and its dependencies are in the scope of this document. This document serves as a map that takes readers from here to OpenSSF and adjacent technologies. Details of the open source technologies are out of the scope of this document. How consumers manage vulnerabilities is out of the scope of this document.   

This document is inspired and based on the previous work conducted by open souece maintainers, contributors and community mmebers.  

## Intended Audience
Open source software maintainers, contributors and consumers are the intended audience of this document.

The document answers these questions:
* As an open source software producer, I'd like to produce more secure open source software. What OpenSSF resources can I leverage to manage vulnerabilities in my own code and dependencies? 
* As an open source software consumer, I'd like to consume secure open source software. What resources does OpenSSF provide for vulnerability management? 
* As an open source software producer and a consumer, I'd like to contribute to open source security technologies for vulnerability management. Where do I start? 

## Nomenclature
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

# Open Source Software Vulnerability Management 

As we discussed in [open source software dependency management](./consumption-architecture-dependency-management.md#open-source-software-dependency-management), open source software is the foundation of the digital world we live in. Managing software dependency is one aspect of vulnerability management. It is critical to manage all aspects of open source software vulnerability in order to sustain open source software security and reliability. OpenSSF has established a [security baseline](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/security_baseline.md) to help minimize vulnerabilities as a software project goes through the development lifecycle. 

The next few sections will dive deeper into these topics to answer OSS producers' and consumers' questions about vulnerability management: 
* [Vulnerability Prevention](#vulnerability-prevention)
* [Asset Inventory](#asset-inventory)
* [Vulnerability Discovery in Your Own Code and Fix](#vulnerability-discovery-in-your-own-code-and-fix)
* [Publicly Known Vulnerability Exploitability and Patching](#publicly-known-vulnerability-exploitability-and-patching)
* [Coordinate Vulnerability Disclosure](#coordinate-vulnerability-disclosure)

## Vulnerability Prevention
Preventing vulnerabilities from happening at the very beginning of the software development life cycle is critical, during the requirement phase, design and initial implementation. Make sure security requirements are clearly documented and well understood. Once design and develop has started, these guidelines will help:
* A memory-safe language is adopted for new projects or new components, in order to reduce memory safety vulnerabilities at scale. [OpenSSF Memory Safety Special Interest Group (SIG)](https://github.com/ossf/Memory-Safety) has best practices and guides for adopting memory-safe languages.
* Two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled for repository interactive access. This will reduce the risks of credential compromise and attacks on the digital assets.
* There are no hard-coded active secrets in the project source repository. OpenSSF has enabled secret scanning for all the repositories to detect hard-coded secretes to prevent unauthorized access to repository assets.
* Credentials are provisioned with minimal permissions. This minimizes security risks by only granting necessary access to reduce potential attack surfaces, whether it's interactive access or programmatic access in your CI/CD pipeline.
* A dependencies policy is published, maintained and followed. The policy sets clear guidelines for selecting and maintaining secure dependencies.
* Direct dependencies are pinned in internet or infrastructure services and applications your project provides. This ensures that only a known safe version of a dependency is used to protect against malware and credential compromise. 
* GitHub actions and workflows, if any, are set up securely and remain secure. This reduces the risk of repository compromise introduced by malpractices in CI/CD pipeline.

Readers will find details of recommended implementation and verification of above security guidelines in these documents:
* [Security Baseline - Once Sandbox](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/security_baseline.md#security-baseline---once-sandbox)
* [Security Baseline - To Become Incubating](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/security_baseline.md#security-baseline---to-become-incubating)
