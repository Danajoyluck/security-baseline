# Introduction
## Context and Scope
This document is the second part of the OpenSSF technology consumption architecture series. It captures the open source technologies that are hosted in OpenSSF, provided by Google, and CNCF. 
Building on [dependency management](./consumption-architecture-dependency-management.md), this document demonstrates how OSS security technologies make software supply chain more secure through vulnerability management. 

The goals of this document are:
1. To help open source producers quickly navigate the OSS security technology landscape, discover, adopt and contribute to technical initiatives that are related to vulnerability management. 
2. To provide an easy model for our end user organizations large and small to have a framework/reference architecture to help them manage vulnerabilities using open source technologies. 

This document is based on the previous work conducted in OpenSSF [BEST Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers):
* [Open Source Software Supply Chain Threats, Threats Definition](https://github.com/ossf/toolbelt/tree/main/threats). 
* [The Security Toolbelt](https://github.com/ossf/Diagrammers-Society/blob/main/drawings/Sterling%20Toolchain%20Patterns.svg).

This document serves as a map that takes readers from here to OpenSSF and adjacent technologies. Details of the open source technologies are out of the scope of this document. How consumers manage vulnerabilities is out of the scope of this document. 

## Intended Audience
Open source software maintainers, contributors and consumers are the intended audience of this document.

The document answers these questions:
* As an open source software producer, I'd like to produce more secure open source software. What OpenSSF resources can I leverage to manage vulnerabilities in my own code and dependencies? 
* As an open source software consumer, I'd like to consume secure open source software. What resources does OpenSSF provide for vulnerability management? 
* As an open source software producer and a consumer, I'd like to contribute to open source security technologies for vulnerability management. Where do I start? 

## Nomenclature
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

# Open Source Software Vulnerability Management 

Open source software Vulnerability management is critical to sustain software security and reliability. 

## Open Source Software Supply Chain Threats

## Open source software Security Technologies for OSS Vulnerability Management 

This section provides an overview of the technology stack that provides OSS vulnerability management , and dives deeper into each of the below areas. Each area depends on the areas below it to provide technology inputs.  


# Get Involved
I hope the document makes it a bit easier to explore the OpenSSF land, discover your interested areas, start engaging with various projects and working groups, and find your joy.
