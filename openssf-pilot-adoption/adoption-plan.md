# OpenSSF Security Baseline Pilot Adoption Plan

## Objective
TAC has approved the [Security Baseline](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/security_baseline.md) for OpenSSF projects. 
The early adoption by pilot projects will demonstrate how to achieve [the desired outcomes](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/security_baseline.md#success-criteria). 

## Scope
GUAC, Protobom, OpenVEX and RSTUF maintainers have committed to having their projects adopting the security baseline. The details of the projects can be found [here](https://github.com/ossf/security-baseline/blob/4cd2bd5a771dfaee94c8d1c527547f7f5eec0ce9/README.md#openssf-security-baseline-adoption-pilot-projects).

## Adoption Friction Points 
We will rely on every adopting project to submit issues to the security baseline repo to log the friction points and provide feedback to refine the security baseline, facilitating easier adoption. 

Maintainers of the security baseline will closely monitor the GitHub issues, help remove blockers and reduce friction points, update security baseline based on feedback from pilot projects.

## Tooling and Process Improvements
Big thanks to our pilot project maintainers! They have committed to share what works well for them, including reusable code, tooling, usability improvement of our tooling and processes. 
We will leverage Slack channels, mailing lists, SIG and WG meetings, TAC meetings to increase the adoption of what works really well, and what can be avoided. 

## Security Baseline Maintenance 
The official/release version of the security baseline document is in TAC repo. It is part of the OpenSSF technical initiative life cycle governance. Changes to the document will have OpenSSF wide impact. 

Need community input on the process to evolve the security baseline and feed the security baseline to downstream TAC. 

Revision to the TAC official security baseline will be a community effort following the [TAC Issue/PR process](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/TAC-Decision-Process.md#issuepull-request-types). 

## Adoption Tracking and Reporting 
The adoption high level tracking will be logged in the [pilot adoption execution plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16YYsJDu1Xw_G3hUVnMiQ9sdvbWoBBt_pHLiVFsYNHVg/edit?gid=1333945810#gid=1333945810). 
The detailed traffic mechanism is manual at this point through a spreadsheet, and it's not scalable. [The tracking is on weekly basis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LCLpN1Hgx7C9M9KNuvH5aN5vukYPmxrq_1dUQrDhnco/edit?gid=818010490#gid=818010490), with the first tracking date as the bench mark date for baseline adoption. Need continuous monitoring solution.
The adoption progress will be reported during the bi-weekly TAC meeting during the time allocated to staff mmebers, and as part of the BEST WG update to TAC on behalf of the SIG.
